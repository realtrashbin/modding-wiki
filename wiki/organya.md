# Organya Music Format



## Overview

Organya (org) is a custom music tracker format created by Pixel in 1999 as an improved version of his other music format - Pixel Music Data(pmd), which was used by his other music editor PiyoPiyo.
It is most prominently known for its use in Cave Story, but several other games use it, too, like [Stargazer](http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiss-me/aji/star/) and [Azarashi 2001](https://www.cavestory.one/pixels-works/azarashi.php).


The format allows the playback of 14-16 simultaneous channels, with 8 note polyphony and 6-8 different percussion instruments, depending on the player used.


Cave Story only allows 6 of the 8 available percussion tracks to be used, and each is hard-coded to a specific instrument. Changing percussion instruments in the editor will not affect which one will be used during playback ingame. **Any notes put in tracks U and I will crash the game**.
These instruments are:

- **Channel Q:** Bass01
- **Channel W:** Snare01
- **Channel E:** HiClose
- **Channel R:** HiOpen
- **Channel T:** Tom01
- **Channel Y:** Per01
- **Channel U:** Unused (Bass01 by default in OrgMaker)
- **Channel I:** Unused (Bass01 by default in OrgMaker)

This is the case because unlike the org editors which use .wav samples for drums, Cave Story uses the `.pxt` (PixTone) format. This means that drum samples in Orgmaker2 can be replaced by downloading the source code and replacing the .wav files, but the other drum formats used in Cave Story will need to be edited using a PixTone editor, such as [PixTone](freeware-asset-replacement) or [SeaTone](freeware-asset-replacement) and can also be extracted via SeaTone's sfx pusher.




## Editors

Two original versions of the org editor have been released to the public, titled [Orgmaker](orgmaker1) and [Orgmaker 2](orgmaker2), respectively.


The Orgmaker 2 editor allows for different drum instruments to be specified.


Several other community efforts have been made to update or completely replace these editors and add some missing quality-of-life features. A notable example of this is [Orgmaker 3](orgmaker3).

There is also a project called **OrganyaMaker-16**, whose initial goal was to double the number of channels from 16 to 32. Furthermore, it also supports flags, which can be used to change the pitch, tempo, and volume of a specific track during playback. Files that use flags or 16 tracks are saved with the `org16` extension and have the org types `Org-10` and `Org-16`, respectively. Since **this format isn't supported by any of the existing engines** - neither natively nor through hacks or mods - it's not described in this article.


## File format


The ORG music file is in binary.


The instruments are baked into the reader (the file tells the player what instrument number to use)


### Header


The first 18 bytes are header info.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Block offset (bytes)</td>

        This can be <code>org-01</code>, <code>org-02</code>, or <code>org-03</code> and corresponds to the capabilities that the file has, such as fancy drums or using more tracks. However, starting with version v1.3.2, OrgMaker writes <code>org-02</code> instead of <code>org-01</code>, regardless of whether pipi is used or not.

### Track Info


After this, there is a chunk of (16 (tracks, including drums AND notes) *6 (bytes of info each)), for a total of 96 bytes.

Structure of the info block for every track is as follows:

### Note Data


The file then goes by individual tracks, starting at track 0 and incrementing to 15 (covering all tracks)


Each track length has the note data in the following order, each piece of data is repeated by the number of notes in the track in question (I.E all the note values are written back-to-back for the first track, then all the pan values, etc.):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Block offset (bytes)</td>
      <td>Size (bytes)</td>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>X location</td>
      <td>Number of dots to the current note starting at zero.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Y location</td>
      <td>
        Key, doesn’t need to be as big of a number, 00 is low, FE is high, FF if the note does not exist (is instead a modifier event like pan/vol).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Note length</td>
      <td>From X location, 01 if note is just something like a volume change.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Note volume</td>
      <td>
        <code>0x00</code> is quiet, <code>0xFF</code> is loud (it's given to undefined notes). Orgmaker limits this between 4 and 252.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Note pan</td>
      <td>Left pan is <code>0x00</code>. <code>0x0C</code> is right pan, given <code>0xFC</code> if undefined.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Total size:</td>
      <td colspan="3">8 bytes</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>


Each note has a total of 8 bytes allocated for it.


When all of the above data is read for each note in the track, the dataset for the next track is presented. If there are no notes in the track, it is skipped. There is no separator data between note data. There is also no termination value; the file ends with the last piece of note data.


Access.org uses only 1 non-percussion channel: **channel 2**. This means that the examples below represent the melody of everybody's favorite Cave Story song.

### ORG Tempo
ORG music can handle 1000 individual notes per second. The wait time is expressed in milliseconds, with the shortest time possible for a single note being 1 millisecond *(having a wait value of "1")*.

To convert BPM to "WAIT", use the following formula:
`60000/(BPM * NPB) = WAIT`

To convert from "WAIT" to BPM, use the following formula:
`60000/(WAIT * NPB) = BPM`

Where:
- `WAIT` is the time in milliseconds each note takes to play (ORG's internal tempo format)
- `NPB` is the number of notes per beat
- `BPM` is the number of beats per minute

Example, with a new org file, the wait value is 128, with 4 notes per beat.
Plugging this in yields: `60000/(128*4)=117.1875`

Converting 117 BPM back to WAIT yields: `60000/(117*4)=128.205`

Note that ORG Wait time is in whole numbers only, so 128.205 would be truncated to 128.
