*:warning: Information Incomplete: Fillers currently in use*

## Overview

Organya(org) is a custom music tracker format created by Pixel in 1999 as an updated version of his previous music program; [PiyoPiyo](PiyoPiyoPage).
It is most prominently known for its use in [Cave Story](https://cavestory.org), but a couple other games use it, too, such as:
- [Stargazer](http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiss-me/aji/star/)
- [Azarashi (2001)](https://www.cavestory.org/pixels-works/azarashi.php) 


The format allows the playback of 14-16 simultaneous channels, with 8 note polyphony and 6-8 different percussion instruments, depending on the player used.


Cave Story only allows 6 of the 8 available percussion tracks to be used, and each is hard-coded to a specific instrument. Changing percussion instruments in the editor will not affect which one will be used during playback ingame. Any notes put in tracks U and I will crash the game.
These instruments are:

- **Channel Q:** Bass01
- **Channel W:** Snare01
- **Channel E:** HiClose
- **Channel R:** HiOpen
- **Channel T:** Tom01
- **Channel Y:** Per01
- **Channel U:** Unused (Bass01 by default in OrgMaker)
- **Channel I:** Unused (Bass01 by default in OrgMaker)

This is the case because unlike the org editors which use .wav samples for drums, Cave Story uses the .pxt or PixTone format. This means that drum samples can be replaced in the same manner as [other sfx](SeaTone'sOrIt'sIncludedPusherPage), but the other drum formats used in Orgmaker2 will need to be recreated using a pixtone editor, such as [PixTone](PixTonePage) or [SeaTone](SeaTonePage).




## Editors

*:warning: Information Incomplete: Too lazy to make the actual pages*

Two original versions of the org editor have been released to the public, titled [Orgmaker](orgmaker1) and [Orgmaker2](orgmaker2), respectively.
There's also been recovered versions, those are: [V1.0](https://www.cavestory.org/downloads/Org1.0.zip), [V1.1](https://www.cavestory.org/downloads/Org1.1.zip), [V1.3.2](https://www.cavestory.org/downloads/Org132.lzh) and [V1.3.3](https://www.cavestory.org/downloads/Org133.lzh).
Although, V1.0 and V1.1 might not entirely be the original versions because during the 90's Pixel often used the .lzh format for compression instead of .zip, this might've be because of .lzh's popularity in Japan at the time.


The Orgmaker2 editor allows for different drum instruments to be specified.


Several other community efforts have been made to update or completely replace these editors and add some missing quality-of-life features. A notable example of this is [Orgmaker3](orgmaker3).


A community member has also made an effort to double the amount of tracks used by OrgMaker to make it more versatile. The project is called *OrganyaMaker-16*.


## File format


The ORG music file is in binary.


The instruments are baked into the reader (the file tells the player what instrument number to use.).


### The Header


The first 6+12 (18) bytes are header info, containing the:
- Org Type (6 char string). This can be `Org-02`, `Org-03` or `Org-16` and corresponds to the capabilities that the file has, such as fancy drums or using more tracks.
- There is an Org Type of `Org-01` but sometime after V1.1, Pixel made OrgMaker write `Org-02` instead, this means Orgmaker will write `Org-02` regardless if pipi is used or not.

- Wait (tempo, 2 bytes), see **Org Tempo**
- Line (number of beats per measure, 1 byte), can also be thought of as the number of vertical "lines" the editor shows between each measure.
- Dot (resolution, number of notes in each beat, 1 byte)
- Repeat_x (start of repeat loop, 4 bytes) (These values are per “dot” individual note, despite the player only allowing these to be set at the start of each measure)
- End_x (end of repeat loop, 4 bytes)

### Track Info




After this, there is a chunk of (16 (tracks, including drums AND notes) *6 (bytes of info each)), for a total of 96 bytes.


Bit structure:
- Frequency (Detunes the track: the farther from frequency 1000 the more the detunement is added.) (2 bytes)
- Wave_no (Waveform/Percussion instrument.) (1 byte)
- Pipi (Only regarded if the header is 2 or greater, otherwise it's set to 0. Is a binary value, it sets an instrument into a pizzicato mode.) (1 byte)
- Note_num (total number of notes in the song from a track, including note modifiers, such as pan or volume events) (2 bytes)

### Note Data






The file then goes by individual tracks, starting at instrument track 0 and incrementing to 15 (covering all tracks)


Each track length has the note data in the following order, each piece of data is repeated by the number of notes in the track in question (I.E all the note values are written back-to-back for the first track, then all the pan values, etc.):
- 4 bytes determining X location (start of note)
- 1 byte determining Y location (tone, doesn’t need to be as big of a number, 00 is low, FF is high, FF if the note does not exist (is instead a modifier event like pan/vol))
- 1 byte determining the length of each note (from X location, 01 if note is just something like a volume change)
- 1 byte determining note volume (`0x00` is quiet, `0xFF` is loud) (Orgmaker limits this between 4 and 252) (`0xFF` is given to undefined notes)
- 1 byte determining note pan (Left pan is `0x00`. `0x0C` is right pan, given `0xFC` if undefined)


Each note has a total of 8 bytes allocated for it.


When all of the above data is read for each note in the track, the dataset for the next track is presented. If there are no notes in the track, it is skipped. There is no separator data between note data. There is also no termination value; the file ends with the last piece of note data.


Access.org uses only 1 non-percussion channel: **channel 2**. This means that the examples below represent the melody of everybody's favorite Cave Story song.

### ORG Tempo:
ORG music can handle 1000 individual notes per second. The wait time is expressed in milliseconds, with the shortest time possible for a single note being 1 millisecond *(having a wait value of "1")*.

To convert BPM to "WAIT", use the following formula:
`60000/(BPM * NPB) = WAIT`

To convert from "WAIT" to BPM, use the following formula:
`60000/(WAIT * NPB) = BPM`

Where:
- `WAIT` is the time in milliseconds each note takes to play (ORG's internal tempo format)
- `NPB` is the number of notes per beat
- `BPM` is the number of beats per minute

Example, with a new org file, the wait value is 128, with 4 notes per beat.
Plugging this in yields: `60000/(128*4)=117.1875`

Converting 117 BPM back to WAIT yields: `60000/(117*4)=128.205`

Note that ORG Wait time is in decimals only, so 128.205 would be truncated to 128.
